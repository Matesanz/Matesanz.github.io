# 🗣️ Talks

## 👁️ I see Nets - (2019-03-20)

That day I talked about **CNN architectures**. How a **convolutional layer** works at base level, how to **train it**, selecting **hyperparameters** and I showed code on how to easily do it using **Tensorflow**. Back that days **I was terrified** by talking for the **first time in front of so many people**, I did it in **English** (what an achievement! 💪), I was working by the University of Malaga and I did it for the **School Of AI association** (kudos to Siraj Raval for that amazing project 💙) that me and some other friends started a few months before to chat about Artificial Intelligence.
