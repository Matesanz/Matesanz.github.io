## üéì **Master** - Artificial Intelligence and Sofware Engineering

<!-- ![UMA](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/Seal_University_of_M%C3%A1laga.png) -->

- **Where**: [University of Malaga](https://www.uma.es/)
- **When**: Sept/**2019** - June/**2020**
- **What I did**: The Master's in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence from the University of M√°laga corresponds to the training period of the PhD Programme in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence offered by this same University. Master focused on the different areas of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Software development**: (Reinforcement Learing, Generative Models, Big Data, Evolutive algorithms...). Mention in Research.
  
- **Master Thesis** (**Graduated with honors**. üåü): [3D MRI Super-Resolution using Generative Adversarial Networks Paper](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AgDuqWQZkjwxj79zyt5colGiRdNT1g?e=1cslcH): development of a super-resolution model for 3D magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, through the use of generative adversarial networks, GANs, that increases x4 the quality of the original dataset. [Repository](https://github.com/Matesanz/WGAN-GP_MRI_Super_Resolution).
- **Multi-Agents Optimization**: Last mile delivery optimization using multi agents theory. [Repository](https://github.com/Matesanz/Last_Mile_MultiAgents).
- **Evolutive Algortihms**: use of optimization algorithms to reconstruct unordered image rows. [Repository](https://github.com/Matesanz/Image_Reconstruction_Evolutive_Algorithms).
- **Big Data**: use Spark to analyze the evolution of taxi prices in New York City during New years eve, [Repository](https://github.com/Matesanz/NYCTaxi_Spark).
- **Generative Models**: Variational Auto Encoders for the generation of new instances on the MNIST dataset.

## üéì **Master** - VR, AR and Videogame Development

<!-- ![VR EVO](https://www.realovirtual.com/files/jobs/27.png) -->

- **Where**: [VR EVO School](https://vr-evo.com/)
- **When**: Sept/**2017** - June/**2018**
- **Description**: Multiple areas related to **Virtual Reality**, **Augmented Reality**, **video-game** development (game theory, procedural generation...), **archviz** were covered in this master. Using. **Unreal Engine 4**, Blender, Maya and 3D MAX. Projects that I developed:

  - **Artsenal experience** ([Video](https://youtu.be/RBG4qE5czRk)): development of a Virtual Reality experience using movement tracking and reconstruction techniques during the XII (2018) edition of *La Noche en Blanco* at the Artsenal Museum in Muelle Uno, M√°laga.
  - **Procedural Museum** ([Video](https://vimeo.com/254240325)): auto generated Virtual Reality museum exhibiting a few of the most famous art pieces in the history. Also a mobile version called **The gallery** ([Video](https://vimeo.com/272375915)).
  - **The Universe** ([Video](https://vimeo.com/273707600)) a mobile app that allows to explore the Solar System.

## üéì **BSc** - Optics Degree

<!-- ![UVA](http://www5.uva.es/getef/img/UVa_cuatricomia_fondo.blanco.jpg)  -->

- **Where**: [University of Valladolid](https://www.uva.es) & [Bicoccas's University](https://en.unimib.it/)
- **When**: Sept/**2011** - June/**2015**
- **Description**: Degree focused in **physics**, **mathematics**, **neurology** and **biology** related to the fields of vision and optics. International **Erasmus** student at **Bicocca University** during the year 2013/2014.

  - **Bachelor Degree Thesis**: [Changes in the Visual Function after the Critical Period](https://uvadoc.uva.es/handle/10324/13397?locale-attribute=it). Study on how do the human vision develops during the first years at a cortex level.
  - **2nd Place at Cooper FORCE Competition 2015**: research on the development of new techniques to adapt multifocal contact lenses.
