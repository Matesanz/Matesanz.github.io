It consisted in a collection of 8 different lessons throughout 2 months . Many students from very diverse engineering fields attended, but also people without much experience in the field or who were looking for a professional reconversion. They learned how to setup their IDE, some python basics (using colab), they trained an agent to solve the cartpole problem using Tensorflow and they saw how this can be applied to robotics using ROS. It has been the most challenging talk (or collection of talks) that I've ever given, so it was for my students, but I learned also a lot on how to correctly teach, and that's the best takeaway I could have ever taken. \ud83e\udd13 \u203c\ufe0fSi est\u00e1s en M\u00e1laga y te interesa la #iA y la #robotica no puedes perderte este incre\u00edble #workshop presencial gratuito organizado por el crack @AIMatesanz fundador de @AIMalaga \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0fMI\u00c9RCOLES de 16:00 a 18:00 en @thegreen_ray #Malaga +Info y plazas aqu\u00ed! https://t.co/DlGYzKEsrO pic.twitter.com/Vkwa7LdjuP \u2014 Spain AI (@Spain_AI_) October 19, 2021 Hoy tocaba intro a redes Neuronales y siguiendo el estilo (para una intro) nada de matem\u00e1ticas y todo PR\u00c1CTICO. \ud83d\udc4c Hoy hemos aprendido a crear y entrenar una NN desde cero para predecir la entrada XOR. \ud83c\udf89 pic.twitter.com/E4DrcfS5TL \u2014 Matesanz (@AIMatesanz) November 18, 2021 El en workshop de IA y rob\u00f3tica de la semana pasada vimos las bases del aprendizaje por refuerzo y esta semana ya estaban implementando algoritmos de RL como Q-Learning.

Using. Unreal Engine 4 , Blender, Maya and 3D MAX. Projects that I developed: Artsenal experience ( Video ): development of a Virtual Reality experience using movement tracking and reconstruction techniques during the XII (2018) edition of La Noche en Blanco at the Artsenal Museum in Muelle Uno, M\u00e1laga. Procedural Museum ( Video ): auto generated Virtual Reality museum exhibiting a few of the most famous art pieces in the history. Also a mobile version called The gallery ( Video ). The Universe ( Video ) a mobile app that allows to explore the Solar System.","title":"\ud83c\udf93 Master - VR, AR and Videogame Development"},{"location":"background/education/#bsc-optics-degree","text":"Where : University of Valladolid & Bicoccas's University When : Sept/ 2011 - June/ 2015 Description : Degree focused in physics , mathematics , neurology and biology related to the fields of vision and optics.

Training and deploying models in GPU and embeded systems. Integrating it functionality using C++ , Docker , Python and ROS . Data : As Data Engineer building from scratch the company's data layer: big data processing with Spark , and real-time data processing with Kafka . As Database engineer taken decisions on how to store data, using databases like Mongo , MySQL and Redis . taking part on the architecture and deployment decisions. Structure from Motion : building 3D reconstructions out of 2D images. Using images from drones to create a point cloud that represents the environment seen by de UAV. Plant Health Analysis : Reasearch project to use pictures taken from special cameras to retrieve information about field health status. Building specific wavelength orthomosaics to be used by agronomists in order to take data based decisions on how to take care of the field. Photovoltaic Panels Analysis : Reasearch project to use pictures taken from special cameras to retrieve information about photovoltaic panels. Detecting anomalous thermal registries on photovoltaic cells to find possible damages on an early stage. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udd2c R+D Developer : IA and Computer Vision Where : University of Malaga When : Dec/ 2018 - Mar/ 2020 What I did : Part of the Smart-Campus I projects ( DIAS2P and StreetQR ): We built a solution to reduce Car-Pedestrian collisions attaching embeded systems running object detection neural network architectures into traffic signs so drivers could be warned about the intention of pedestrians to cross the street using lights. Registries about urban mobility were also recorded. The paper was published at CIPI 2019 and some media like 20 Minutos and M\u00e1laga Hoy published news about the project. My role by field: Deep Learning : Training different neural networks architectures (YOLO, SSD-MobileNet, Mask-RCNN...) to detect and predict real-time car-pedestrian collisions. Deployment in IoT and embedded systems like Jetson Nano Family. Object tracking algorithm development (Hungarian Algorithm). Electronics : Designing electronic architecture to run some actuators (sound and lights) that warn the driver about the presence of pedestrinas in the street. Data : Building an API using Firebase to register statistics into a database about how many cars/pedestrians crossed the street. \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Full-Stack Developer Where : Monkeat When : Mar/ 2019 - Oct/ 2019 What I did : As part of the incubation program offered by Demium we founded Monkeat, a livetime marketplace to help pubs to boost their customer acquisition through real-time offers. As CTO I developed a full Progressive Web App using Vue + Ionic , MongoDB , Flask and Firebase . We could not finally validate our MVP and closed the project months after.","title":"\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Professional Experience"},{"location":"background/experience/#professional-experience","text":"Here you can find my main professional roles .
